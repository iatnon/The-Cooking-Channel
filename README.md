This github repository includes both elements of task 3 for the course Artificial Intelligence and the Web given at Osnabrueck Univesity.

The channel.py file includes the code for a cooking channel that is monitared and assisted by a helpful cooking ai agent which is powered by gemini 1.5 flash text. It includes filtering and a maximum number of messages. The cooking assist will provide the users with recipes, tips and nutritional information.

The client.html file includes a client that can view the hub will this channel and all other channels. The client allowes the user to enter their name once and it will be remembered for the rest of the session. The client also provides the user with a search function allowing them to find their favorite channel quickly. In addition to that the channel list does not dissappear when a channel is viewed. The client is able to parse markdown text in any messages enhancing the user experience. 

Both files are depoloyed to university server, but in thie repository they are set up to be ran locally.
